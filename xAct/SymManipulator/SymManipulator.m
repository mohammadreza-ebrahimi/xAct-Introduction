ImposeSym::usage="ImposeSym[expr, inds, sym] creates a symmetrized expression equivalent to ImposeSymmetry[expr, inds, sym]. The result is displayed as SymH objects. If expr, already has the symmetry sym, expr is returned as is is. The output is 0 if the result due to single terms symmetries can be reduced to zero.
